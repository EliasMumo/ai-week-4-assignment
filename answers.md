What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.
Key Features:

Supports deep learning and numerical computation
Uses computational graphs for efficient execution
Runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs
Includes pre-trained models and tools like TensorBoard
Main Difference Between TensorFlow and PyTorch in Computation Graphs:

TensorFlow: Uses static computation graphs, meaning the graph is defined before execution.
PyTorch: Uses dynamic computation graphs, allowing real-time modifications during execution.
What is Keras, and on Which Frameworks Can It Run?
Keras is a high-level deep learning API designed for ease of use.
It can run on: TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).

Key Features of Scikit-learn:

Provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction
Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
Easy-to-use APIs for machine learning tasks
Supports model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
Purpose of Jupyter Notebooks and Key Features:
Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for coding, data analysis, and visualization.
Key Features:

Supports live code execution with Markdown support
Enables inline data visualization
Supports multiple languages (Python, R, Julia)
Ideal for data science and machine learning projects
Purpose of the Dropout Layer in the TensorFlow Example:
The Dropout layer prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training, improving model generalization.

Role of the Optimizer in the PyTorch Example and Which Optimizer Is Used:
The optimizer updates model parameters to minimize the loss function.
Common optimizer used: Adam, SGD, or RMSprop.

Purpose of the Conv2D Layer in the Keras Example:
The Conv2D layer applies convolutional filters to detect spatial patterns (e.g., edges, textures) in image data.

Type of Model Used in the Scikit-learn Example and Dataset Applied To:
Example: Logistic Regression model applied to the Iris dataset for classification.

Output of the Jupyter Notebook Example and Library Used for Visualization:

The output is typically a graph or chart
The visualization is generated using Matplotlib or Seaborn
